# SkilStak Pro Project Plan - Fall 2016

I am trying to get the SkilStak agario server to work, using [OgarUL](https://github.com/AJS-development/Ogar-unlimited).
This includes things such as a private and custom client.

## Objectives

* Get it working
* Keep my Pro invite

## Reference Links

[In progress]()

*Every Pro student must open at least one GitHub Enhancement issue
on two different Pro project plan repos by the third week of class
or lose their Pro invite.*

*The quality of all comments made on others projects will be taken
into consideration for further Pro invites. Silly or extraneous
comments will not be considered comments resulting in an immediate
loss of the invite.*
